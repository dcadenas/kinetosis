= Kinetosis

Read XYZ orientation data from the Sudden Motion Sensor
present in most recent Apple laptops.

Kinetosis is a small Ruby extension written in C.

(Based on the old [sudden_motion_sensor](https://github.com/xunker/sudden_motion_sensor) gem)

== Prerequisites

* Apple laptop with the Sudden Motion Sensor
* Snow Leopard (Probably)

== Installation

    gem install kinetosis

== Usage example

    require 'kinetosis'

    include Kinetosis

    # Trap ^C and exit
    trap("SIGINT") { exit! }

    # Call and print the result from the xyz method
    loop do
      c = xyz.map { |v| v.to_s.ljust(4) }
      puts "x: #{c[0]} y: #{c[1]} z: #{c[2]}"
    end

=== You would probably do something like this in the real worldâ„¢:

    require 'kinetosis'

    class MacBookPro
      include Kinetosis
    end

    mbp = MacBookPro.new

    puts mbp.x
